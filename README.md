What is **Notified** ? It's a game made with [Love2D Engine](https://love2d.org/) for the 41th Ludum Dare Game Jam. The theme of this LD was **Combine 2 Incompatible Genres** so I made a "Explore a phone" game with different minigames (3).

I don't have the time to made a perfect game but I'm going to upgrade them with a new version in the future, so stay tuned!

If you want to play the game, you can visit it [Itch Page](https://bigaston.itch.io/notified) !
